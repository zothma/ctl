# `ctl` - Global Linux controller
`ctl` is a command line tool for manipulating the most basic features of computers with a single utility : audio, brightness, battery, network... It is currently under development.

## Idea
This utility won't manipulate your computer per se, it will only ask the right command corresponding to the need. The idea is to create a faster way to control your laptop or your desktop, without having to remember each and every specific command, depending on your distribution and on your installed packages. It can also come in handy when sharing configurations and dotfiles if they're using specific commands: people will no longer need to adapt the configs to make it work.

This utility is meant to work with :

- [ ] Volume
- [ ] Brightness
- [ ] Battery
- [ ] Network
- [ ] Bluetooth
